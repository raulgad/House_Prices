Competition - [House Prices - Advanced Regression Techniques](https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/overview)
Done:
- Data preprocessing
- Feature engineering
- Models training: Lasso, Ridge, StackingCVRegressor, Catboost
- Hyperparameters tuning with Optuna
- Feature analysis with a 'Feature importances' and 'Permutation importances'
- Clustering with a KMeans algorithm and dimension reduction techniques: PCA, t-SNE and UMAP
- Best result was achieved with blended mondels: __357th__ place out of __5164__ with a RMSLE metric __0.12046__
